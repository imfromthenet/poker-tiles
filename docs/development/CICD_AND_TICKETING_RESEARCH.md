# CI/CD and Ticketing System Research

## Executive Summary

This document contains comprehensive research on implementing CI/CD and ticketing systems for the PokerTiles project. The primary constraints are:
- **Private GitHub repository** (limiting free CI/CD minutes)
- **Cost minimization** (avoiding expensive API calls)
- **macOS/Swift development** requirements

### Recommended Solution
GitHub Actions with self-hosted runner + GitHub Issues with local AI (Ollama) = **$0/month**

## CI/CD Options Analysis

### 1. GitHub Actions with Self-Hosted Runner (Recommended)
**Cost: $0/month**

#### Benefits
- ✅ Unlimited free minutes for private repositories
- ✅ Native macOS support
- ✅ Seamless GitHub integration
- ✅ No cloud infrastructure needed

#### Implementation
```bash
# Download and configure runner from GitHub repo settings
# Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner
```

#### Key Points
- Self-hosted runners provide unlimited minutes at no cost
- Perfect for macOS/Swift development
- Runs on your local Mac
- Full access to Xcode and signing certificates

### 2. GitHub Actions with Cloud Runners
**Cost: Limited to 2,000 minutes/month for private repos**

#### Limitations
- ❌ Only 2,000 free minutes per month
- ❌ macOS runners consume minutes faster (10x multiplier)
- ❌ Can exhaust quota quickly with frequent builds

### 3. GitLab CI/CD
**Cost: 400 minutes/month free tier**

#### Major Limitation
- ❌ **No macOS runners on free tier** (only Linux)
- ❌ Would require self-hosted runner anyway
- ❌ Less integration with existing GitHub repository

### 4. Jenkins (Self-Hosted)
**Cost: $0/month**

#### Benefits
- ✅ Completely free and open source
- ✅ Mature Xcode/Swift support via plugins
- ✅ Full control over build environment

#### Drawbacks
- ⚠️ Complex setup and maintenance
- ⚠️ Requires local server management
- ⚠️ Less modern UI/UX compared to GitHub Actions

## Ticketing System Options

### 1. GitHub Issues + Local AI (Recommended)
**Cost: $0/month**

#### Implementation Strategy
- Use GitHub Issues (built-in, free)
- Install Ollama with DeepSeek-Coder or CodeLlama
- Create GitHub Actions that trigger local AI analysis
- No Claude API costs!

#### Local AI Setup
```bash
# Install Ollama
brew install ollama

# Pull DeepSeek-Coder-V2 (best for coding tasks)
ollama pull deepseek-coder-v2:16b

# Alternative: CodeLlama (lighter weight)
ollama pull codellama:13b
```

### 2. Linear (Free Tier)
**Cost: $0/month (free tier), $8/user/month (paid)**

#### Benefits
- ✅ Modern UI with excellent UX
- ✅ Full API access on free tier
- ✅ Native GitHub integration
- ✅ AI agents can be team members
- ✅ Supports Claude, ChatGPT integrations

### 3. Self-Hosted Solutions

#### Redmine
- ✅ Mature, feature-rich issue tracking
- ✅ Full API for integrations
- ⚠️ Older UI, requires server setup

#### Gitea
- ✅ Lightweight GitHub alternative
- ✅ Built-in issue tracking
- ✅ Easy to self-host
- ⚠️ Would require migrating from GitHub

### 4. Claude Code GitHub Actions
**Cost: ~$0.01-0.10 per issue (API costs)**

#### How It Works
- Install Claude GitHub app via `/install-github-app`
- @claude mentions in issues trigger AI analysis
- Claude can create PRs, implement features, fix bugs

#### Cost Concerns
- Each issue interaction costs API tokens
- Can become expensive with frequent use
- Not suitable for high-volume automation

## Local AI Alternatives

### Why Local AI?
- **Zero API costs** - runs on your Mac
- **Complete privacy** - code never leaves your machine
- **No rate limits** - process as many issues as needed
- **Good performance** - modern models rival cloud offerings

### Recommended Models

#### DeepSeek-Coder-V2
- Best performance for coding tasks
- 16B parameter model
- Rivals GPT-4 for code generation
- Requires ~32GB RAM

#### CodeLlama
- Lighter weight option (7B, 13B variants)
- Good for basic code tasks
- Runs on 16GB RAM

#### Integration Approach
1. Set up webhook from GitHub to local server
2. Process issues with local AI
3. Post results back via GitHub API
4. Automate common tasks (triage, labeling, suggestions)

## Cost Comparison

| Solution | CI/CD Cost | Ticketing Cost | Total Monthly |
|----------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| GitHub + Self-hosted + Local AI | $0 | $0 | **$0** |
| GitHub Cloud + Claude API | $0* | $10-50 | $10-50 |
| GitLab + Linear | $0** | $0-8 | $0-8 |
| Jenkins + Redmine | $0 | $0 | **$0** |

\* Until 2,000 minute limit exceeded  
\** Only 400 minutes, no macOS runners

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: CI/CD Setup (Week 1)
1. Configure self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on Mac
2. Create basic workflow for build and test
3. Set up Xcode project for CI/CD
4. Configure code signing for automated builds

### Phase 2: Local AI Setup (Week 2)
1. Install Ollama and download models
2. Test AI capabilities with sample issues
3. Create webhook receiver script
4. Build GitHub API integration

### Phase 3: Automation (Week 3)
1. Connect GitHub Issues to local AI
2. Implement automatic issue triage
3. Set up PR automation workflows
4. Create documentation and runbooks

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 4)
1. Fine-tune AI prompts for better results
2. Add monitoring and logging
3. Optimize build times
4. Create backup and recovery procedures

## Security Considerations

### Self-Hosted Runner Security
- Keep runner on secure, dedicated machine
- Use separate user account with limited permissions
- Regular security updates
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### Local AI Security
- Models run entirely offline
- No code leaves your network
- Regular model updates for improvements
- Secure webhook endpoints

## Conclusion

For a private repository with macOS/Swift development needs and cost constraints, the optimal solution is:

1. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with self-hosted runner
2. **Ticketing**: GitHub Issues with local AI (Ollama + DeepSeek)
3. **Total Cost**: $0/month
4. **Setup Complexity**: Medium
5. **Maintenance**: Low

This approach provides unlimited CI/CD minutes, powerful AI assistance without API costs, and maintains complete privacy and control over your development pipeline.
