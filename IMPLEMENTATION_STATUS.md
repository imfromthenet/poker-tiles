# PokerTiles Implementation Status

## What We Have Built

### Core Window Management System
1. **AccessibilityWindowManager** - Uses AXUIElement API to move/resize windows
2. **AppleScriptWindowManager** - Fallback using AppleScript
3. **WindowManipulator** - Unified interface that tries multiple methods
4. **GridLayoutManager** - Calculates grid layouts (2x2, 3x3, etc.)
5. **WindowResistanceDetector** - Identifies problematic windows

### Permissions
- **PermissionManager** - Checks and requests Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions
- Both permissions are required:
  - Screen Recording: To detect windows (✅ Working)
  - Accessibility: To move windows (❓ Not working despite being granted)

### UI Components
- Main app shows detected poker tables
- Grid layout selection (2x2, 3x3, cascade, stack)
- Quick Actions view with layout buttons
- Permission status display
- Hotkey configuration (using native CGEventTap)

### Current Poker Detection
- Detects windows from: PokerStars, 888poker, GGPoker, PartyPoker, etc.
- Identifies table types: Cash, Tournament, Sit & Go
- Groups tables by application

## The Problem

**Windows are NOT moving despite:**
- ✅ Permissions granted in System Preferences
- ✅ Windows being detected correctly
- ✅ UI showing the windows
- ✅ Layout calculations working
- ❌ Actual window movement failing

## What Happens When "Arrange" is Clicked

1. User clicks "Arrange Tables" or grid button
2. `GridLayoutView.arrangeInSelectedLayout()` is called
3. Checks permissions (returns true)
4. Calls `windowManager.arrangePokerTablesInGrid(layout)`
5. Which calls `windowManipulator.arrangeWindowsInGrid()`
6. For each window, calls `setWindowFrame()`
7. Which calls `moveWindow()` and `resizeWindow()`
8. Tries AccessibilityWindowManager first
9. Falls back to AppleScriptWindowManager
10. **Both fail silently**

## Potential Issues

1. **WindowInfo might not have correct references** - The SCWindow object might be stale
2. **AXUIElement lookup failing** - Can't find the window via Accessibility API
3. **Coordinate system mismatch** - macOS uses different coordinate systems
4. **Permission not actually working** - Despite being granted

## Next Steps

1. Create a minimal test to verify basic window movement works
2. Add more detailed error logging to see exactly where it fails
3. Test with a simple, known window (like TextEdit)
4. Verify the WindowInfo → AXUIElement conversion works
