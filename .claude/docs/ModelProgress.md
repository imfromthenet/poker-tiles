# SwiftData Models Implementation Progress

## ✅ Task 1: Set up SwiftData models (Completed)

### Updates:
- Fixed build errors related to SwiftData relationships
- Made all model properties optional for CloudKit compatibility
- Updated computed properties to handle optional values safely
- Added CloudKit integration:
  - Created CloudKitManager for account status and setup
  - Configured ModelContainer with `cloudKitDatabase: .automatic`
  - Set up CloudKit zones and subscriptions
  - CloudKit entitlements already present in project

### What was implemented:

1. **Created Localization System**
   - `Localized.swift` - Type-safe localization keys using enums
   - `Localizable.xcstrings` - Modern String Catalog for iOS 26
   - Support for easy localization with `Localized.Category.key.localized` pattern

2. **Core Data Models**
   - **UserProfile**: User's personal information with CloudKit sync support
     - Properties: name, age, weight, height, biological sex, activity level
     - Computed properties: BMI, BMR, TDEE
     - CloudKit metadata fields (optional)
   
   - **NutritionalGoals**: Daily nutritional targets
     - Macros: calories, protein, carbs, fats
     - Micros: fiber, sugar, sodium
     - Computed percentage calculations
     - Linked to UserProfile with cascade delete
   
   - **Recipe**: Recipe information with nutritional data
     - Basic info: name, description, prep/cook time, servings
     - Full nutritional breakdown per serving
     - Ingredients and instructions as arrays
     - Nutrition scoring algorithm for meal matching
   
   - **MealPlan & MealPlanItem**: Daily meal planning
     - Date-based meal plans per user
     - Meal types: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack
     - Computed totals for all nutritional values
     - Cascade delete for items

3. **Key Design Decisions**
   - All models include CloudKit sync metadata (optional fields)
   - Used SwiftData's `#Unique` macro for preventing duplicates
   - Proper relationships with delete rules
   - Localized display names for all enums
   - No string literals - everything uses localization keys

4. **Updated App Structure**
   - Modified `NutritionAssistApp.swift` to include all models in schema
   - Updated `ContentView.swift` with tab bar structure
   - Removed default Item model

### Folder Structure:
```
NutritionAssist/
├── Models/
│   ├── UserProfile.swift
│   ├── NutritionalGoals.swift
│   ├── Recipe.swift
│   └── MealPlan.swift
├── Localization/
│   └── Localized.swift
├── Profile/
├── Recipes/
├── MealPlanning/
└── Localizable.xcstrings
```

### Next Steps:
- Task 2: Create user profile and onboarding flow
- Task 3: Implement Foundation Models integration
