# Apple Foundation Models Framework Reference

## Overview

Apple's Foundation Models framework provides APIs for integrating on-device and cloud-based machine learning models into iOS, macOS, and other Apple platform applications. This framework is part of Apple's broader AI/ML ecosystem alongside Core ML and Create ML.

## Key Concepts

### On-Device Intelligence
- Privacy-focused approach with on-device processing
- Reduced latency for real-time applications
- Works offline without network connectivity
- Leverages Apple Silicon neural engines

### Model Types
- Language models for text generation and understanding
- Vision models for image analysis and generation
- Multi-modal models combining text and vision
- Domain-specific models for specialized tasks

## Integration with iOS 26

### Requirements
- iOS 26.0+
- Xcode 16.0+
- Swift 6.0+

### Basic Usage Pattern

```swift
import FoundationModels
import SwiftUI

@Observable
class ModelManager {
    private var model: FoundationModel?
    
    func loadModel() async throws {
        model = try await FoundationModel.load(.default)
    }
    
    func processText(_ input: String) async throws -> String {
        guard let model else { throw ModelError.notLoaded }
        return try await model.generate(from: input)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var manager = ModelManager()
    @State private var input = ""
    @State private var output = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Enter text", text: $input)
            Button("Process") {
                Task {
                    output = try await manager.processText(input)
                }
            }
            Text(output)
        }
        .task {
            try? await manager.loadModel()
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Performance
- Load models asynchronously during app initialization
- Cache model instances to avoid repeated loading
- Use batch processing for multiple inputs
- Monitor memory usage with large models

### Privacy
- Process sensitive data on-device when possible
- Clearly communicate when using cloud-based models
- Follow Apple's privacy guidelines for ML features
- Request appropriate permissions for data access

### Error Handling
- Handle model loading failures gracefully
- Provide fallback options for unsupported devices
- Implement timeout mechanisms for long-running operations
- Log errors for debugging without exposing user data

## Common Use Cases

### Text Generation
- Auto-completion in text fields
- Smart replies and suggestions
- Content summarization
- Translation services

### Vision Tasks
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Scene understanding
- Visual search

### Multi-Modal Applications
- Image captioning
- Visual question answering
- Content-based recommendations
- Accessibility features

## SwiftUI Integration

```swift
struct ModelPoweredView: View {
    @Environment(\.foundationModel) private var model
    @State private var isProcessing = false
    
    var body: some View {
        // View implementation
    }
}

// App-level setup
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    @State private var modelEnvironment = ModelEnvironment()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environment(\.foundationModel, modelEnvironment.model)
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing Considerations

- Use mock models for unit tests
- Test error handling paths
- Verify performance on older devices
- Validate privacy compliance
